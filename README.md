## Closing Notes

Thank you to the SLC Team for providing us this opportunity. I learned a lot reading through the codebase, and hope to work on it in the future. Regardless of whether I get selected though, I won't regret working on these tasks as I had a lot of fun doing them. They were really well thought out and will definitely help whomsoever gets to join the team to hit the ground running and start contributing effectively. <br>
Thank you :D
